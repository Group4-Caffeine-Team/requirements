## Yaman Ayoun 

## Anas Al Shammah

## Ammar Tarawneh

## Ala' Abusalem

First, the project was planned and the main idea of the work was known.
and that was during the meeting, which lasted about an hour.
I was able to know the capabilities of the members that will be great during the work, and each person has what distinguishes him:
as Anas Al Shammah has good experience, while Ala' Abusalem had ideas and suggestions Characteristically, Ammar Tarawneh possessed team spirit and cooperation.

We have determined how to communicate between us and I have created a group on slack, and we will hold a daily meeting on Zoom to find out what is new and solve problems at work.

When working as a team, some conflicts may arise, so I will be present at every moment, and we may resort to the teacher if there is a claim.
And I will not allow one person to impose his opinion on the whole team, but everyone will contribute to the work and opinions
So we will deal with each other in the form of one person and agree on everything because we will definitely face some problems and people who do not work as required. 
I will tell him that thing and the teacher will be informed of that.

We will be creating a frontend and a backend on Github and these are our primary repositories for publishing work and organization in publishing.
